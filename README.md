# Project:
Game-Store is a simple web project for a mock game store, built using only HTML and CSS.<br/> 
The website is designed to showcase a game store interface, typically including pages such as the homepage, game listings, and an about page. It offers a visually structured and user-friendly layout for browsing games, mimicking an e-commerce experience for gaming products. <br/><br/>

Project from my 4th Semester (Mid). <br/>
